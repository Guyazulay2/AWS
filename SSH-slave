  [ chmod 400 guy.pem ]
   
(2). After that you can connect with the following command : 
   
  [ ssh -i "guy.pem" ubuntu@ec2-18-224-108-201.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com ]

(2). Now create keygen by the following command : [ ssh-keygen ]

Do [ cat id_rsa.pub ] And you will see the key that you created.

Do [ sudo nano authorized_keys ] And copy the key you created in the previous machine.
